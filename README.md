# Notebook

This is a full-stack notebook website where users can write notes. The features include adding, deleting, and updating notes. Users need to create an account with valid credentials, log in, and then can add notes. Another user cannot see the notes written by a different user. It operates like a personal notebook.
This notebook has two backends, one built with the MERN stack and the other with the PERN stack. 
In the MERN stack, i used Mongoose Schema, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, Express-validator, JSON Web Token, and bcrypt to create APIs.
In the PERN stack, i used Prisma Schema, PostgreSQL, Express, Node.js, Express-validator, JSON Web Token, and bcrypt to create APIs.

# By default, this website is running on PERN stack.

If you want to run it with the MERN backend, there will be some changes on the frontend. In the code, where it's commented as 'For MongoDB,' you need to uncomment that line, and where it's commented as 'For Postgres,' you need to comment that line.

# The file that needs to be changed on the frontend when using the MERN backend is:
Folder context/notes/NoteState.js
Folder components/Notes.js
Folder components/NoteItem.js
# The technologies used in building this are:
Front-End : ReactJS React Redux
Back-End  : MERN PERN

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
